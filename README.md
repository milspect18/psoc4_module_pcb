# PSOC4 Module PCB
A very small footprint PSOC 4000 module for microcontroller projects.

The PSOC4 CY8C4246PVI-DS402 microcontroller includes an integrated low-dropout power regulator which means it can be wired directly to a small 3.7 v lipo battery.  This module includes the necessary de-coupling capacitors to filter input power, as well as a pull-up resistor for the reset line.  The only other thing on the board is a 10-pin 1.27mm 2x5 ARM SWD debug header for firmware loading and debugging.

This project has been uploaded to OSH Park and can be ordered here: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/bZPw8Fch

The board has been made and tested to work.
